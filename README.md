# AI-bot-for-Flappybird-
Developing AI bot for flappybird using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms.Designed and implemented an AI-powered Flappy Bird game using neural networks and genetic algorithm for evolution through custom made crossover and mutation techniques.

The project is designed in three stages : 
1. Game Development : Design of the game using an object oriented approach and graphics using pygame module of python. 
2. Neural Networks : The neural network (one for each chromosome) is used to decide whether the game agent (bird) will jump or not
3. Evolution : Genetic optimization of previous generations to produce optimized offsprings that perform better

Results and Analysis

The proposed crossover algorithm performance better overall as compared to some widely used crossover techniques such as Uniform crossover, Multipoint Crossover, Single Point Crossover etc. For our purposes, the results are at par with other techniques like NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies)

Future Work -
Modifying the project structure to be able to incorporate games that have multiple user inputs.
Apply the crossover techniques to other domains and observe performance
